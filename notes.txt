DISCOS
 - We needed to make constructors for Monster and Protag.
 - The attributes of Character could not be private else, the subclasses did not have access to them.
 - When you want to copy a file in terminal, use the command cp [path to og file] [path to cloned file]
QCC
 - Do we need to set specific values for the attributes for both Monster and Protag or should it be random?
 - How should the stats of the protag compare to the monsters? Should they be balanced and how?
